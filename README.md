# project2 Technical Report
Group project: Donny, Greg, Kaitlyn, Kali, Ahmed

In this project, the team performed an ETL on Video Games data sets. We were interested in consolidating a number of data sources into one RDS for future analysis. Our project proposal:

**Project 2: Video Games Dataset**
**Team: Kaitlyn, Kali, Greg, Donny, Ahmed**

Project Proposal:
In this project we will ETL a few separate datasets that combine various video game titles, sales, rankings and reviews. We will Extract the proper column and rows using PG Admin and Pandas and identify Primary Keys for the proposed date. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook we will Transform and clean the dataset and then Load cleaned data back into a final RDS via PgAdmin.

**Datasets:**
https://www.kaggle.com/arslanali4343/sales-of-video-games
https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/video-games-dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/andreshg/videogamescompaniesregions?select=video-games-developers.csv 
https://www.kaggle.com/baynebrannen/video-game-sales-2020?select=vgchartz-7_7_2020.csv 

**Process and Steps:**
1. We first researched data sources and found sufficient information on Kaggle.com
2. We reviews data sets and determined that the files had the needed information.
3. We build a github repo to store our work.
4. **Kaitlyn to add Table set up steps**
5. .png files are noted in the repo that represent the quickdb schema
6. **Kalli to add Jupyter steps**
7.
